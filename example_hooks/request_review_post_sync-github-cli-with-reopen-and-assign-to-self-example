# request_review_post_sync hook using GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com)
#
# This hook handles requesting review after the sync step of the request review
# command has completed.
#
# In this particular case a pull request will be created within GitHub by using
# the GitHub CLI. If re-requesting a review the browser will open
# the associated pull request in the browser.
# Therefore, you need to make sure that you have the GitHub CLI
# installed, in your PATH, and have logged into it for this hook to work.
#
# Setup:
# > brew install gh
# > gh auth login

re_requesting_review=$1 # string of "true" or "false"
branch_to_integrate=$2 # string of the branch name to integrate (e.g. ps/rr/your-patches-branch-name)
branch_to_integrate_into=$3 # string of the branch name to integrate into (e.g. main)

# If true then open the PR to view it online else create it
if [ "$re_requesting_review" == "true" ]; then
  gh pr view "$branch_to_integrate" --web 
else
  # Consider using the reviewer flag on a project level hook if you have teams like @dev ie: --reviewer @dev
  gh pr create --assignee @me --fill --web --base "$branch_to_integrate_into" --head "$branch_to_integrate"
