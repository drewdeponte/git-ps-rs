# request_review_post_sync hook using GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com)
#
# This hook handles requesting review after the sync step of the request review
# command has completed.
#
# In this particular case a pull request will be created within GitHub by using
# the GitHub CLI. If re-requesting a review the browser will open
# the associated pull request in the browser.
# Therefore, you need to make sure that you have the GitHub CLI
# installed, in your PATH, and have logged into it for this hook to work.
#
# Setup:
# > brew install gh
# > gh auth login
