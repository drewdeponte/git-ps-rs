# list_additional_information hook using GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com)

# Simple example usage which adds some info from the PR on github to each patch.

# First, you need to make sure that you have the GitHub CLI
# installed, in your PATH, and have logged into it for this hook to work.
#
# Setup
#
# - install github cli - on macOS - brew install gh
# - login to github cli - gh auth login

# Outcome is in the format of "<first letter of PR state> <number of comments> <if approved then MONEY!>"
# So an example output of gps ls might be:
# 2    rr                234cc3 This patch has no PR
# 1    rr    O 1         31d593 This patch is open with one comment
# 0    rr    M 2 $       52c50c This patch has an approved and merged PR with 2 comments

patch_index=$1 # integer, git-ps index of the current patch
patch_status=$2 # git-ps status of the patch. b / rr / int / rr+ â†“ etc.
patch_oid=$3 #
patch_summary=$4 # the first line of the commit message

str=$(gh pr list --search "$4 in:title" --limit 1 --json state,comments,reviews --template \
	'{{range .}}{{printf "%.1s" .state}} {{len .comments}} {{range .reviews}}{{if eq .state "APPROVED"}}${{end}}{{end}}{{end}}')
