# request_review_post_sync hook using GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com)
#
# This hook handles requesting review after the sync step of the request review
# command has completed.
#
# In this particular case it is creating a pull request within GitHub by using
# the GitHub CLI. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have the GitHub CLI
# installed, in your PATH, and have logged into it for this hook to work.
#
# Setup
#
# - install github cli - on macOS - brew install gh
# - login to github cli - gh auth login

branch_to_integrate=$1 # string of the branch name to integrate (e.g. ps/rr/your-patches-branch-name)
branch_to_integrate_into=$2 # string of the branch name to integrate into (e.g. main)
remote_name=$3 # string of the remote name (e.g. origin)
remote_url=$4 # string of the remote url

# TODO: rework this to fetch the re_requesting_review state from GitHub
# if [ "$re_requesting_review" != "true" ]; then
# 	gh pr create --fill --base "$branch_to_integrate_into" --head "$branch_to_integrate" -R "$remote_url"
# fi

# Note: In the case where $re_requesting_review is true we don't want to do
# anything in the hook other than exit successfully because all we want to
# happen is that the remote branch is pushed up. The sync step of the
# request review command takes care of. Hence, there is nothing for us to do
# here. If this hook was implementing say an email based workflow then it would
# likely create and send a new email.
